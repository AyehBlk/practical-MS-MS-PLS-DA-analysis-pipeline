## 🎯 Overview

This repository provides ready-to-use R scripts for performing **Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA)** on tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data. Specifically designed for **small sample sizes** commonly encountered in metabolomics studies.

### ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **Optimized for small n** - Works with as few as 10 samples (5 per group)
- ✅ **Multiple entry points** - Comprehensive, quick-start, and data formatting scripts
- ✅ **Publication-ready plots** - Beautiful ggplot2 visualizations
- ✅ **Cross-validation** - Leave-one-out CV for small sample sizes
- ✅ **Biomarker discovery** - VIP scores for feature ranking
- ✅ **Platform-agnostic** - Works with xcms, MZmine, MS-DIAL, MetaboAnalyst, and more
- ✅ **Comprehensive documentation** - Complete README with examples and troubleshooting

## 📊 What is PLS-DA?

**PLS-DA (Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis)** is a supervised machine learning method that:

- 🎯 Maximizes separation between predefined groups (e.g., Control vs Treatment)
- 📉 Reduces high-dimensional data to interpretable components
- 🔍 Identifies discriminant features (biomarkers)
- 📈 Creates visualizations similar to PCA but with better classification

### PLS-DA vs PCA

| Feature | PCA | PLS-DA |
|---------|-----|--------|
| **Type** | Unsupervised | Supervised |
| **Goal** | Maximize variance | Maximize group separation |
| **Uses group info** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Better for classification** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Biomarker discovery** | Limited | ✅ Excellent |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```r
# Install required packages
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "ggrepel", "caret"))

# Install Bioconductor packages
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("mixOmics")
```

### Minimal Example (30 seconds)

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(mixOmics)

# 1. Load data
msms_data <- read.csv("feature_matrix.csv", row.names = 1)
annotation <- read.csv("sample_annotation.csv")

# 2. Preprocess
msms_log <- log2(msms_data + 1)
msms_t <- t(msms_log)

# 3. PLS-DA
plsda_result <- plsda(msms_t, annotation$Condition, ncomp = 2)

# 4. Cross-validate
plsda_cv <- perf(plsda_result, validation = "loo")
accuracy <- (1 - plsda_cv$error.rate$overall[, 2]) * 100

# 5. Plot
plsda_scores <- as.data.frame(plsda_result$variates$X)
plsda_scores$Condition <- annotation$Condition

ggplot(plsda_scores, aes(x = X1, y = X2, color = Condition)) +
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  stat_ellipse(level = 0.95) +
  labs(title = paste0("PLS-DA (Accuracy: ", round(accuracy, 1), "%)")) +
  theme_bw()
```

**That's it!** You now have a PLS-DA plot with cross-validated accuracy.
